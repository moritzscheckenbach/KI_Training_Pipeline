The dataset includes 255 images.
Obstacles-KFD3-zGin are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
